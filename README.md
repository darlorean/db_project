# UEFA Champions League Database Project

This project involves designing, implementing, and analyzing a relational database based on the UEFA Champions League data (2016â€“2022). It demonstrates the full lifecycle of database development, including schema design, data insertion, and visualization. The repository includes the following components:

1. **Database Design**:
   - Detailed ER and relational models representing entities such as players, teams, matches, tournaments, and goals.
   - Implementation of database schema with integrity constraints (e.g., foreign keys, `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and `CHECK` conditions) using SQLite.

2. **Data Processing and Insertion**:
   - Scripts for creating the database schema and populating tables with real and synthetic data.
   - Python scripts (`sqlite3` library) automate data insertion and ensure data consistency.

3. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Jupyter notebooks for generating insightful visualizations, such as team goal distribution, player performance, and seasonal trends.
   - SQL queries for in-depth data analysis, including team performance, top scorers, and match statistics.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive report detailing the database design process, integrity checks, and implementation highlights.
   - README and organized file structure for clear navigation and reproducibility.

This project serves as a robust example of database development, combining advanced SQL, Python scripting, and data visualization techniques to analyze football data effectively.
